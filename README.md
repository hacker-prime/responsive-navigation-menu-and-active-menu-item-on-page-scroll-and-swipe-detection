# Responsive Navigation Menu & Active Menu Item On Page Scroll & Swipe Detection

The project or repository is a combination of three different features at the same time. Why? I wasn't able to find an existing project or repository or tutorial that had all at the same time and therefore I had to integrate them. The tutorials I used can be found in the acknowledgement section. 

The 1st acknowledgement uses the **active menu item on page scroll feature** of which I never saw before.I spent some time in the exploration and discovery of that feature and documented it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgm4AhmLKVM). 

The 2nd acknowledgement uses an **animation for the hamburger menu item or element when it's selected** and brings out the side navigation for mobile devices. 

The 3rd acknowledgement is for being able to **swipe the screen from left to right in order to close the side navigation**. 

In summary, the combination of all of this in one project or repository would serve as a useful and reusable feature or component for websites.
